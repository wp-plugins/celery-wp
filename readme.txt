== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a preorder campaign = 

A preorder campaign allows you to being accepting orders before you are ready to ship. You accept credit cards now and charge
them only when you are ready to ship.

= What types of preorder campaigns are popular? =

Sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have popularized crowdfunded preorder campaigns. Instead of (or in addition to) one of those,
you may prefer extend your reach by running Celery on your WordPress site.

No SSL is required. Celery presents as an IFRAME or overlay which is secured. You do not need to do anything.

= Do I need a merchant account like PayPal or Authorize.net? =

No. Celery partners with Stripe for credit card transactions. You need an account with them.
